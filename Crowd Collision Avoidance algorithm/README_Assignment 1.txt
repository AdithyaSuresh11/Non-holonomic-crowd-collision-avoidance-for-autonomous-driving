The values used for simulation while coding the agent.py file are:

SCENARIO: 3_agents and 8_agents:

alpha = 1
beta = 1
gamma = 2
number of samples in 100 - 1000 range. Here, we chose H = 500
theta angle range = 0 to 2*pi
radius range = 0 to 2
The simulation time step = 0.1 seconds
The rest of the values are taken from the basic simulator.py file
Additional libraries like import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

SCENARIO: crossing_agents:

alpha = 1
beta = 1
gamma = 2
number of samples in 100 - 1000 range. Here, we chose H = 200 (Choice that needs to be altered during this condition)
theta angle range = 0 to 2*pi
radius range = 0 to 2
The simulation time step = 0.1 seconds
The rest of the values are taken from the basic simulator.py file
Additional libraries like import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
